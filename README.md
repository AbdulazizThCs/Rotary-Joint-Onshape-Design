# RotaryJoint-Design
**3D mechanical joint model built using Onshape.**


# Rotary Joint
A rotary joint is a key mechanical component that enables rotational motion between two parts.  
Itâ€™s commonly used in robotics, automation arms, and mechanical linkages for smooth and controlled rotation.


# Files 
- `RotaryJoint.SLDPRT` â€“ Editable 3D part file  
- `RotaryJoint_v1.STL` â€“ Exported 3D model for printing/viewing


# How to Use
